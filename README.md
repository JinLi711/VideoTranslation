# Video Translation

Our basic goal is to take a video and an image / another video and merge them.

# Contributing 

We’ll push all our code [here](https://github.com/MLUChicago/VideoTranslation). You don’t have direct access to that repository. What you want to do is fork the repo (aka make a copy) on to your own account. When you modify your code, you have unlimited access to your own copy and you can push to your own account. When you feel that you are ready, make a pull request to `MLUChicago/VideoTranslation` so that you can push your changes to that repository.

By implementing this process, this reduces the amount of conflict that you will have with your teammates.

## Notes
Please don't push large files.
